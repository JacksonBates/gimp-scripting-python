This collection of scripts was published as a series of tutorial pieces to help people learn how to script the GNU Image Manipulation Program.

The material hasn't been touched for four years, so it may be stale - caveat emptor!

It was originally publised in blog, video and gist form.

I'm collecting them in a normal repo after all this time so that anyone can contribute PRs if they would like to fix anything.
